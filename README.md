# Akan Name Generator

### Author: Ann Wanjeri

This is a name generating website that borrows from the Akan, Ghanaian naming system. It is part of my second prep assessment for the Moringa Software Development course. It allows the website user to input their birthdate and gender and provides them their Akan name.
